    <h1>Common Cyber Attacks on Livestreams</h1>

    <p class="first-paragraph">
        Livestreaming platforms are common targets for cyberattacks due to the massive amounts of personal data shared by streamers and users alike. Understanding the most frequent threats is key to protecting yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Phishing Attacks</h2> <!-- New header added here -->

    <p>
        Phishing Attacks are very common on streaming platforms. The way Phishing Attacks are executed is very simple, someone acts friendly with good intentions in the livestream chat, posting a link/message. The link gets clicked by you and others and gathers your personal information.
