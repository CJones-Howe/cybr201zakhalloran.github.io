    <h1>The Dangers of Livestreams</h1>

    <p class="first-paragraph">
        Live-streaming refers to the real-time broadcasting of video and audio content over the internet. Livestreams can be a dangerous environment to be in, through interacting with others in the chat-box and the constant misuse of personal information. Through the history of livestreams there are plenty of cyber attacks, active swatting people, documents being leaked, and accounts being terminated.

       Specific cyber-risks that you may come across consist of "data breaches", "malware distribution", "phishing attempts", and "data leaks". To learn more about what cyber-risks you can encounter under different platform, check out our designated pages in the nav-bar.

<p class="spaced-paragraph">
    The Domain Name System (DNS) works with the live-streaming platforms by translating the "human-readable"domain name "example.tv" Ito the IP address that are used by the computers in order to communicate. The dark side to DNS is when "spoofing" occurs, which redirects the user to a fake website, infecting their device with malware and other credential theft.
